# Autobahn|JS Documentation

## First Contact

If you're new to Autobahn|JS, then please take a look at [Getting Started](getting-started.md) first.

You may also want to read up a bit on the [Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)](http://wamp-proto.org/why/) which it implements.

And finally, we suggest visiting the [Crossbar.io site](http://crossbar.io). Crossbar.io is a WAMP router maintained by the people behind Autobahn|JS, and the documentation there includes examples for some aspects of building WAMP applications - all of which use Autobahn|JS.
