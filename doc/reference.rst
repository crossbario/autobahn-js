API Reference
=============


Library
-------

The library can be included

.. code-block:: javascript

   try {
      // for Node.js
      var autobahn = require('autobahn');
   } catch (e) {
      // for browsers (where AutobahnJS is available globally)
   }


Autobahn bundles whenjs and cryptojs, and the bundled libraries can be accessed like this

.. code-block:: javascript

   try {
      var autobahn = require('autobahn');
      var when = require('when');
      var crypto = require('crypto-js');
   } catch (e) {
      var when = autobahn.when;
      var crypto = autobahn.crypto;
   }


Library Version
+++++++++++++++

|ab| library version is available (read-only):

.. js:function:: autobahn.version

   :returns: *string* - version number of loaded library


Debug Mode
++++++++++

To enable *debug mode*, define a global variable

::

   AUTOBAHN_DEBUG = true;

*before* including |ab|. E.g.

.. code-block:: html

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <body>
         <script>
            AUTOBAHN_DEBUG = true;
         </script>
         <script src="https://autobahn.s3.amazonaws.com/autobahnjs/latest/autobahn.min.jgz">
        </script>
      </body>
   </html>


Connections
+++++++++++

A new connection is created using

.. js:function:: autobahn.Connection(options)

   :param object options: connection options

   :returns: *object* - autobahn connection object

Example: **Create a new connection**

.. code-block:: javascript

   var connection = new autobahn.Connection({
                              url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:9000/',
                              realm: 'realm1'
                           });


Connection Methods
++++++++++++++++++

To **open a connection**:

.. js:function:: autobahn.Connection.open

This will establish an underlying transport (like WebSocket or long-poll) and create a new session running over the transport.

When the transport is lost, automatic reconnection will be done. The latter can be configured using the ``options`` provided to the constructor of the ``Connection`` (see below).

To **close a connection**:

.. js:function::   autobahn.Connection.close(reason, message)

   :param uri reason: optional WAMP URI providing a closing reason, e.g. ``com.myapp.close.signout`` to the server-side
   :param string message: optional (human readable) closing message

   :returns: *string* on connection close error, else *undefined*

When a connection has been closed explicitly, no automatic reconnection will happen.


Connection Callbacks
++++++++++++++++++++

``autobahn.Connection`` provides two callbacks:

 * ``autobahn.Connection.onopen``
 * ``autobahn.Connection.onclose``

The **connection open callback** is fired when the connection has been established and a new session was created. This is the main callback which application code will hook into.

.. code-block:: javascript

   autobahn.Connection.onopen = function (session) {
      // Underlying transport to WAMP router established and new WAMP session started.
      // session is an instance of autobahn.Session
   };

The **connection open callback** is passed the ``autobahn.Session`` object which has been created on opening the connection.

The **connection close callback** is fired when the connection has been closed explicitly, was lost or could not be established in the first place.

.. code-block:: javascript

   autobahn.Connection.onclose = function (reason, details) {
      // connection closed, lost or unable to connect
   };

``reason`` is a string with the possible values

 * ``"closed"``: The connection was closed explicitly (by the application or server). No automatic reconnection will be tried.
 * ``"lost"``: The connection had been formerly established at least once, but now was lost. Automatic reconnection will happen **unless you return falsy** from this callback.
 * ``"unreachable"``: The connection could not be established in the first place. No automatic reattempt will happen, since most often the cause is fatal (e.g. invalid server URL or server unreachable)

``details`` is an object containing the ``reason`` and ``message`` passed to :js:func:`autobahn.Connection.close`

Connection Options
++++++++++++++++++

The constructor of :js:func:`autobahn.Connection` provides various options.

**Required** options:

 * ``url``: *string* - the WebSocket URL of the WAMP router to connect to, e.g. ``ws://myserver.com:8080/ws``
 * ``realm``: *string* - The WAMP realm to join, e.g. ``realm1``

**Optional** options:

Options that control the underlying **transport**:

 * ``transports``: *object* or *object* - Transport configuration (default: **{ type: "websocket" }**)
 * ``transport.type``: *string* - Alias of the factory that is used to construct the transport (default: **websocket**).
 * ``transport.*``: *any* - Configuration options per transport.
.. note:: See Transport Factory below.

Options that control what **kind of Deferreds** to use:

 * ``use_es6_promises``: *boolean* - use deferreds based on ES6 promises
 * ``use_deferred``: *callable* - if provided, use this deferred constructor, e.g. ``jQuery.Deferred`` or ``Q.defer``

.. note:: Using ES6-based promises has certain restrictions. E.g. no progressive call results are supported.

Options that control **automatic reconnection**:

 * ``max_retries``: *integer* - Maximum number of reconnection attempts (default: **15**)
 * ``initial_retry_delay``: *float* - Initial delay for reconnection attempt in seconds (default: **1.5**).
 * ``max_retry_delay``: *float* - Maximum delay for reconnection attempts in seconds (default: **300**).
 * ``retry_delay_growth``: *float* - The growth factor applied to the retry delay between reconnection attempts (default: **1.5**).
 * ``retry_delay_jitter``: *float* - The standard deviation of a Gaussian to jitter the delay on each retry cycle as a fraction of the mean (default: **0.1**).

Options that control **WebSocket subprotocol handling**:

 * ``skip_subprotocol_check``: Not yet implemented.
 * ``skip_subprotocol_announce``: Not yet implemented.


Connection Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++

To get the session oject if there is a session currently running over the connection:

.. js:attribute:: Connection.session

   Returns an instance of ``autobahn.Session`` if there is a session currently running on the connection.

To check whether the connection (the transport underlying) is established:

.. js:attribute:: Connection.isOpen

   Returns ``true`` if the Connection is open.

To check whether the connection is currently in a "try to reconnect" cycle:

.. js:attribute:: Connection.isRetrying

   Returns ``true`` if reconnects are being attempted.


A property with the **Deferred factory** in use on this connection:

.. js:attribute:: Connection.defer

   Returns the Deferred factory function in use on the connection.


A Deferred factory for the type of Deferreds (whenjs, ES6, jQuery or Q) in use with the connection:

.. js:function:: Connection.defer

   :returns: a Deferred of the type specified in the call to the connection constructor :js:func:`autobahn.Connection`

Transport Factory
-----------------

Custom transports can be used by registering a transport factory via ``autobahn.transports``:

.. js:function:: autobahn.transports.register(alias, factory)

   :param string alias: *optional* the alias of the transport factory
   :param class factory: the factory class providing factory().create() method and factory.type attribute


For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function TransportFactoryClass(transport_options) {
     this.options = transport_options;
   }
   TransportFactoryClass.type = "my_custom_transport";
   TransportFactoryClass.prototype.create = function () {};

   autobahn.transports.register("my_custom_transport", TransportFactoryClass);

Or without an alias, the identifier will be taken from the class.name attribute:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function TransportFactoryClass(transport_options) {
     this.options = transport_options;
   }
   TransportFactoryClass.type = "my_custom_transport";
   TransportFactoryClass.prototype.create = function () {};

   autobahn.transports.register(TransportFactoryClass);

which then can be used for the connection transport:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var connection = new autobahn.Connection( {
     transports: {
         type: "my_custom_transport",
         url: "ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws",
         connect_timeout: 30

     });


Sessions
--------

WAMP sessions are instances of ``autobahn.Session`` that are created by connections:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var connection = new autobahn.Connection({
                              url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:9000/',
                              realm: 'realm1'
                           });

   connection.onopen = function (session) {

      // session is an instance of autobahn.Session

   };

   connection.open();


Session Properties
++++++++++++++++++

Session objects provide a number of properties.

A read-only property with the WAMP **session ID**:

.. js:attribute:: Session.id

   Returns the session ID as an integer.

A read-only property with the **realm** the session is attached to:

.. js:attribute:: Session.realm

   Returns the realm the session is attached to as an integer.

A read-only property that signals if the **session is open** and attached to a realm:

.. js:attribute:: Session.isOpen

   Returns ``true`` if the session is open.

A read-only property with the **features** from the WAMP Advanced Profile available on this session (supported by both peers):

.. js:attribute:: Session.features

   Returns an object with the roles the client implements and the available advanced features for each role.

A read-only property with an array of all currently **active subscriptions** on this session:

.. js:attribute:: Session.subscriptions

   :value: array

A read-only property with an array of all currently **active registrations** on this session:

.. js:attribute:: Session.registrations

   Returns an array with the subscription objects for all currently active subscriptions.

A property with the **Deferred factory** in use on this session:

.. js:attribute:: Session.defer

   Returns the Deferred factory function in use on the session.

A Deferred factory for the type of Deferreds (whenjs, ES6, jQuery or Q) in use with the session:

.. js:function:: Session.defer

   :returns: a Deferred of the type specified in the call to the connection constructor :js:func:`autobahn.Connection`



Session Logging
+++++++++++++++

|ab| includes a logging method for convenient logging from sessions.


.. js:function:: session.log(output)

   :param any output: *optional* the output to log - any JavaScript data type

``session.log`` can be used without an ``output`` argument when it is assigned as an event handler.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   connection.onopen = function (session) {

      session.log("Session open.");

      session.call('com.timeservice.now').then(
            session.log(now);
      );
   };

which will log to the console:

::

   WAMP session 2838853860563188 on 'realm1' at 3.902 ms
      Session open.
   WAMP session 2838853860563188 on 'realm1' at 4.679 ms
      2014-03-13T14:09:07Z

The log method will log the WAMP session ID and the realm of the session, as well as a timestamp that provides the time elapsed since the *construction* of the ``autobahn.Session`` object.


URI Shortcuts
+++++++++++++

Establish an URI prefix to be used as a shortcut:

.. js:function:: session.prefix(shortcut, prefix)

   :param string shortcut: the shortcut for the provided prefix URI
   :param URI prefix: an URI prefix

..note:: URI prefixes must only contain full URI components, i.e. stop at a '.' separation of an URI. 'com.myapp.topics' is a valid prefix if it is to be used as part of full URI 'com.myapp.topics.one', but invalid if it is intended to be combined with a suffix to form 'com.myapp.topicsnew'.


**Example**:

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.prefix('api', 'com.myapp.service');

You can then use `CURIEs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE>`_ in addition to URIs:

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.call('api:add2').then(...);

which is equivalent to

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.call('com.myapp.service.add2').then(...);

To remove a prefix:

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.prefix('api', null);

To resolve a prefix (normally not needed in user code):

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.resolve('api:add2');


Subscribe
---------

To subscribe to a topic on a `session`:

.. js:function:: session.subscribe(topic, handler, options)

   :param URI topic: is the URI of the topic to subscribe to
   :param callable handler: the event handler that should consume events
   :param object options: *optional* - options for subscription (see below)

   :returns: *promise* that resolves to an instance of ``autobahn.Subscription`` when successful, or rejects with an instance of ``autobahn.Error`` when unsuccessful


The ``handler`` must be a callable

::

    function (args, kwargs, details)

where

1. ``args`` is an array with event payload
2. ``kwargs`` is an object with event payload
3. ``details`` is an object which provides event metadata


Example: **Subscribe to a topic**

.. code-block:: javascript

   function on_event1(args, kwargs, details) {
      // event received, do something ..
   }

   session.subscribe('com.myapp.topic1', on_event1).then(
      function (subscription) {
         // subscription succeeded, subscription is an instance of autobahn.Subscription
      },
      function (error) {
         // subscription failed, error is an instance of autobahn.Error
      }
   );

or, differently notated, but functionally equivalent

.. code-block:: javascript

   var d = session.subscribe('com.myapp.topic1', on_event1);

   d.then(
      function (subscription) {
         // subscription succeeded, subscription is an instance of autobahn.Subscription
      },
      function (error) {
         // subscription failed, error is an instance of autobahn.Error
      }
   );


Active Subscriptions
++++++++++++++++++++

A list of subscriptions (in no particular order) currently active on a ``session`` may be accessed via :js:attr:`Session.subscriptions`.

This returns an array of ``autobahn.Subscription`` objects. E.g.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var subs = session.subscriptions;
   for (var i = 0; i < subs.length; ++i) {
      console.log("Active subscription with ID " + subs[i].id);
   }

.. note:: Caution: This property and the subscription objects returned should be considered read-only. DO NOT MODIFY.


Unsubscribing
+++++++++++++

You can unsubscribe a previously established ``subscription``

.. js:function:: session.unsubscribe(subscription)

   :param object subscription: an instance of autobahn.Subscription

   :returns: a *promise* that resolves with a boolean value when successful or rejects with an instance of ``autobahn.Error`` when unsuccessful.

.. note:: If successful, the boolean returned indicates whether the underlying WAMP subscription was actually ended (``true``) or not, since there still are application handlers in place due to multiple client-side subscriptions for the same WAMP subscription to the broker.


Example: **Unsubscribing a subscription**

.. code-block:: javascript

   var sub1;

   session.subscribe('com.myapp.topic1', on_event1).then(
      function (subscription) {
         sub1 = subscription;
      }
   );

   ...

   session.unsubscribe(sub1).then(
      function (gone) {
         // successfully unsubscribed sub1
      },
      function (error) {
         // unsubscribe failed
      }
   );


Complete Examples:

 * `PubSub Unsubscribe <https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/wamp/basic/pubsub/unsubscribe>`_


Publish
-------

To publish an event on a ``session``:

.. js:function:: session.publish(topic, args, kwargs, options)

   :param URI topic: the URI of the topic to publish to
   :param array args: *optional* - application event payload
   :param object kwargs: *optional* - application event payload
   :param object options: *optional* - specifies options for publication (see below)

   :returns: a *promise* if ``options.acknowledge`` is set, else nothing

Examples: **Publish an event**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!']);

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', [], { text: 'Hello, world' })

Complete Examples:

 * `PubSub Basic <https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/wamp/basic/pubsub/basic>`_
 * `PubSub Complex Payload <https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/wamp/basic/pubsub/complex>`_


Acknowledgement
+++++++++++++++

By default, a publish is not acknowledged by the *Broker*, and the *Publisher* receives no feedback whether the publish was indeed successful or not.

If supported by the *Broker*, a *Publisher* may request acknowledgement of a publish via the option ``acknowledge`` set to ``true``.

With acknowledged publish, the publish method will return a promise that will resolve to an instance of ``autobahn.Publication`` when the publish was successful, or reject with an ``autobahn.Error`` when the publish was unsuccessful.

Example: **Publish with acknowledge**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!'], {}, {acknowledge: true}).then(
      function (publication) {
         // publish was successful
      },
      function (error) {
         // publish failed
      };
   );


Receiver Black-/Whitelisting
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the feature is supported by the *Broker*, a *Publisher* may restrict the actual receivers of an event beyond those subscribed via the options

 * ``exclude``
 * ``eligible``

``exclude`` is an array of WAMP session IDs providing an explicit list of (potential) *Subscribers* that won't receive a published event, even though they might be subscribed. In other words, ``exclude`` is a blacklist of (potential) *Subscribers*.

``eligible`` is an array of WAMP session IDs providing an explicit list of (potential) *Subscribers* that are allowed to receive a published event. In other words, ``eligible`` is a whitelist of (potential) *Subscribers*.

The *Broker* will dispatch events published only to *Subscribers* that are not explicitly excluded via ``exclude`` **and** which are explicitly eligible via ``eligible``.

Example: **Publish with exclude**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!'], {}, {exclude: [123, 456]});

The event will be received by all *Subscribers* to topic ``com.myapp.hello``, but not the sessions with IDs ``123`` and ``456`` (if those sessions are subscribed anyway).

Example: **Publish with eligible**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!'], {}, {eligible: [123, 456]});

The event will be received by the sessions with IDs ``123`` and ``456``, if those sessions are subscribed to topic ``com.myapp.hello``.


Publisher Exclusion
+++++++++++++++++++

By default, a *Publisher* of an event will not itself receive an event published, even when subscribed to the topic the *Publisher* is publishing to.

If supported by the *Broker*, this behavior can be overridden via the option ``exclude_me`` set to ``true``.

Example: **Publish without excluding publisher**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!'], {}, {exclude_me: false});


Publisher Identification
++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the feature is supported by the *Broker*, a *Publisher* may request the disclosure of its identity (its WAMP session ID) to receivers of a published event via the option ``disclose_me`` set to ``true``.

Example: **Publish with publisher disclosure**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!'], {}, {disclose_me: true});

If the *Broker* allows the disclosure, receivers can consume the *Publisher's* session ID like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function on_event(args, kwargs, details) {
     // details.publisher provides the Publisher's WAMP session ID
     // details.publication provides the event ID
   }

   session.subscribe(on_event, 'com.myapp.topic1');


Register
--------

To register a procedure on a ``session`` for remoting:

.. js:function:: session.register(procedure, endpoint, options)

   :param URI procedure: the URI of the procedure to register
   :param callable endpoint: the function that provides the procedure implementation
   :param object options: *optional* - specifies options for registration (see below)

   :returns: a *promise* that resolves to an instance of ``autobahn.Registration`` when successful, or rejects with an instance of ``autobahn.Error`` when unsuccessful.

The ``endpoint`` must be a callable

    function (args, kwargs, details)

where

1. ``args`` is an array with call arguments
2. ``kwargs`` is an object with call arguments
3. ``details`` is an object which provides call metadata

and which returns either a plain value or a promise, and the value is serializable or an instance of ``autobahn.Result``.

The ``autobahn.Result`` wrapper is used when returning a complex value (multiple positional return values and/or keyword return values).


Example: **Register a procedure**

.. code-block:: javascript

   function myproc1(args, kwargs, details) {
      // invocation .. do something and return a plain value or a promise ..
   }

   session.register('com.myapp.proc1', myproc1).then(
      function (registration) {
         // registration succeeded, registration is an instance of autobahn.Registration
      },
      function (error) {
         // registration failed, error is an isntance of autobahn.Error
      }
   );

 * `RPC Slow Square <https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/wamp/basic/rpc/slowsquare>`_


Active Registrations
++++++++++++++++++++

A list of registrations (in no particular order) currently active on a ``session`` may be accessed like via :js:attr:`Session.registrations`.

This returns an array of ``autobahn.Registration`` objects. E.g.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var regs = session.registrations;
   for (var i = 0; i < regs.length; ++i) {
      console.log("Active registration with ID " + regs[i].id);
   }

.. note:: Caution: This property and the registration objects returned should be considered read-only. DO NOT MODIFY.


Unregistering
+++++++++++++

You can unregister a previously established ``registration``

.. js:function:: session.unregister(registration)

   :param object registration: instance of autobahn.Registration

   :returns: a *promise* that resolves with no value when successful or rejects with an instance of ``autobahn.Error`` when unsuccessful.


Example: **Unregistering a registration**

.. code-block:: javascript

   var reg1;

   session.register('com.myapp.proc1', myproc1).then(
      function (registration) {
         reg1 = registration;
      }
   );

   ...

   session.unregister(reg1).then(
      function () {
         // successfully unregistered reg1
      },
      function (error) {
         // unregister failed
      }
   );



Call
----

To call a remote procedure from a ``session``:

.. js:function:: session.call(procedure, args, kwargs, options)

   :param URI procedure: the URI of the procedure to call
   :param array args: *optional* - call arguments
   :param object kwargs: *optional* - call arguments
   :param object options: *optional* - options for the call (see below)

   :returns: a *promise* that will resolve to the call result if successful (either a plain value or an instance of ``autobahn.Result``) or reject with an instance of ``autobahn.Error``.

Example: **Call a procedure**

.. code-block:: javascript

   session.call('com.arguments.add2', [2, 3]).then(
      function (result) {
         // call was successful
      },
      function (error) {
         // call failed
      }
   );
