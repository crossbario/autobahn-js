# Tests for AutobahnJS functionality

Tests run using NodeJS. Run by doing 

```
npm test
```

in the `package` directory.


## First run

* You need to have NodeJS installed.
* Do `npm install`

If all assertions fail, this may be because of different line ending formats for the created test_*.txt files.   
In this case you need to remove the files and create a known good set of files on your system!
